This software was written as part of a research project at University of South Carolina CEC from 2013-2014, "to create an inexpensive computer-based augmented reality training simulator to supplement existing hands-on training, in order to allow institutions to more efficiently utilize fewer ultrasound machines for training purposes".

The project is documented in this paper:

We're releasing it under an MIT license in the spirit of the NSF grant that funded the research:

> NSF expects significant findings from research and education activities it supports to bepromptly  submitted  for  publication,  with  authorship  that  accurately  reflects  the  contributions  of  those  involved.  It  expects  investigators  to  share  with  other  researchers,  at  no  more  than  incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the data, samples, physical collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of the work. **It also encourages grantees to share software and inventions or otherwise act to make the innovations they embody widely useful and usable.**
